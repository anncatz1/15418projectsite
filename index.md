# Exploring Concurrent Union-Find
Members: Annie Xu, Henry Liu

[Proposal:](https://anncatz1.github.io/15418projectsite/proposal)

[Milestone Report:](https://anncatz1.github.io/15418projectsite/midreport)

### SUMMARY OF PROJECT
We will implement 4 versions of the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure:
1. Serial
2. Coarse-Grained Locking
3. Fine-Grained Locking
4. Lock-Free

We will compare the performances of these implementations against a variety of test inputs and usage scenarios to demonstrate the application of and motivation behind Lock-Free Union-Find.
