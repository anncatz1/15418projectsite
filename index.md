### Project Summary
We will implement 3 versions of the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure:
1. Serial
2. Coarse-Grained Locking
3. Lock-Free

We will compare the performances of these implementations against a variety of test inputs and usage scenarios to demonstrate the application of and motivation behind Lock-Free Union-Find.
