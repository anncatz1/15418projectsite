# Exploring Concurrent Union-Find
## Milestone Report
Members: Annie Xu, Henry Liu

[Proposal](https://anncatz1.github.io/15418projectsite/proposal)

### Work Completed Currently

We have written code for the sequential version, the coarse-grain locking version, and lock-free version of union-find. We have done extensive research on these different versions and different algorithm changes to these versions we can make that we will intend to implement in code to explore performance differences later. We are currently testing these different versions of union-find to see how performance differs especially across our different kinds of test cases.
